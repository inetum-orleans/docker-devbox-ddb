??? question "ddb fails to run with message: `version 'GLIBC_2.25' not found`"

    It seems you are running an old linux distribution, like Ubuntu 16.04.

    You should either install ddb from pip, or use `ddb-linux-older-glic` binary from 
    [github release page](https://github.com/inetum-orleans/docker-devbox-ddb/releases).

    Then set `core.release_asset_name: ddb-linux-older-glic` inside your ddb configuration (`~/.docker-devbox/ddb.yml`)
    to make `ddb self-update` download this edition.
