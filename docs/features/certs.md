Certs
===

For some project, we needed to have SSL activated for HTTPS access of our projects. So, SSL certificates became a
project dependency.

The issue was that in local environments, sometimes we cannot open port 80 to the world and get a true Let's Encrypt
certificate or don't want to use the native *traefik* certificate management.

One solution we found is to manage certificates using [CFSSL](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) to generate and
manage a true certificate generation locally. This feature currently handle only CFSSL certificate generation and
management.

Certificate generation
---

When running `ddb configure` command, this action will be triggered. Based on the configuration, the right certificate
manager will be used to generate the appropriate certificate in the `certs.destination` folder if it does not already
exist.

At the end, it will trigger a `certs.generated` and `certs.available` event which can be used by other features to use
those generated certificates.

For instance, the [traefik](./traefik.md#certificates-installation-feature) is listening for the `certs.available` event
in order to update the configuration in order to use them for HTTPS.

Certificate removal
---

When running `ddb configure` command, this action will be triggered. Based on the configuration, if certificates was
generated before and the `certs.type` is switch to something else than `cfssl`, those certificates will be deleted.

At the end, it will trigger a `certs.removed` event which can be used by other features to update themselves.

For instance, the [traefik](./traefik.md#certificates-installation-feature) is listening for the `certs.removed` event
in order to update the configuration in order to remove them.
