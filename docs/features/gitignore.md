Automatic management of gitignore
---

ddb generates a bunch of files inside your project sources: target files from templates, binary shims, ...

As those files may depends on your environment configuration, they should not be added to the git repository and must 
be added to `.gitignore`, for them to be generated on each environment without spoiling git repository.

Because adding them manually to `.gitignore` is a chore, ddb automatically adds all generated files to the nearest 
`.gitignore` file, from top to bottom of filesystem folder hierarchy. The other way round, if a generated file source 
is removed, the target file will also be removed from `.gitignore` file.

Finally, using the `enforce` configuration, you can force files to be added to the gitignore, even if it is not a file 
managed by ddb.
