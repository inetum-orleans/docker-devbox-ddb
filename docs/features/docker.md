Docker
===

The docker feature brings docker and docker-compose integration. You may also check [Jsonnet Feature](./jsonnet.md), as
using jsonnet docker specific library brings many Docker related features to `ddb`.

!!! quote "Defaults"
    ```yaml
    docker:
      interface: docker0
      ip: 172.17.0.1
      user:
        gid: 1000
        uid: 1000
        group: null
        name: null
    ```

docker-compose configuration processing
---

When a `docker-compose.yml` is found or generated from templates, the content is parsed.

All labels prefixed `ddb.emit.` are processed and converted into event and event arguments.

!!! info "Creation of binaries"
    Whether you use `ddb.Binary()` in jsonnet template or manually add labels to `docker-compose.yml`, they 
    are converted into ddb configuration and shims are generated to run the declared binary as simple executable 
    command, thanks to [shell](shell.md) feature.
